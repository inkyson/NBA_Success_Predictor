# NBA_Success_Predictor

## Overview 

In this project, we will build a supervised machine learning to analyze a dataset of NBA players from 2003 to 2020 in order to predict whether players will be successful in the NBA. We intend to construct this model with two levels, our first level will seek to predict success based on the minutes played per game, and if players are determined to be successful, then it will test for if the players have the potential to be elite based on their win share percentage. 

Our group is heavily invested in the NBA, and during the brainstorming process, we honed in on the topic of player evaluation and the importance that holds in the league. Thus, we were interested in what could be seen as determining factors for a players success and how teams might evaluate players during the draft process. The dataset for this project currently holds every NBA player's individual season statistics from 2003-2004 season to the 2019-2020 season. In addition to this, we have collected their alma mater, college statistics, and physical measurements.

Key Questions
- What makes a player successful in the NBA?
- How can a potential draft bust be identified?
- Does the college that each player went to serve as an indicator of success?
- What are the differentiating factors between successful, league average players, and elite level players?

## Project Management and Organization

Our team is primarily communicating through Slack, as well as weekly zoom meetings. Inky is heading the project management and she has created a Google Sheet file that transparently lays out the weekly tasks for the project to ensure that we are completing everything in a timely and efficient manner, and equally splitting the duties between the group.
