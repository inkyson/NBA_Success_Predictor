# Segment 1 - Machine Learning Model, Github

For the first segment of the machine learning model, we have taken in the data from our provisional database, a CSV file, and assigned output labels for the input data. 

I have also written the readme file for this week to overview our group's communication and work throughout the week.

# Segment 2 - Database, Presentation

This week, I worked on the Database and Presentation segments of the project. 

For the database, I constructed an ERD with the primary tables that we will be using, there are other tables created in our schema that we have decided to not use. 

I wrote the queries to create the 4 tables and imported the data into each table. 

Then, I joined the nba_players and nba_college_stats tables to create a new table with all the NBA stats and college stats for NBA players from 2003-2019, who played in college.

Lastly, I loaded in the newly joined table into a jupyter notebook file, where we will use it next week to further develop our machine learning model.
